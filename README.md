# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Preethi!

## A User Experience Designer/ Developer based in Phoenix.
## I am here to help build your dreams and ideas into focused clear products while Designing a unique and uncharted user experience!!

I am a graduate student specializing in UX design, passionate about designing and developing user-friendly and impactful digital experiences. With a strong foundation in UX principles, I aim to combine design and technology to create intuitive products that solve real-world problems. My technical skills include user research, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development. I enjoy coding, especially when it involves crafting interactive and responsive interfaces. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new design trends, experimenting with different coding projects, and immersing myself in creative pursuits like photography and digital art. After graduation, I hope to work as a UX designer or developer, where I can bring my ideas to life and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

> The world is constantly evolving thanks to designers centring their process around the user. Creatives design an experience through a series of touch-points that form the framework to have a meaningful interaction. It starts with understanding what the user wants
